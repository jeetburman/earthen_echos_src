              The Story Behind Our Purpose
            </h3>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
              <p>
                Earthen Echoes was born from a simple yet profound realization: in our increasingly automated world, the irreplaceable value of human craftsmanship was being lost. We witnessed talented artisans struggling to reach global markets while consumers yearned for authentic, meaningful products with real stories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our founders, Sarah Chen and Rajesh Patel, traveled extensively through craft communities across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They saw firsthand how traditional techniques were disappearing as younger generations moved to cities, leaving behind centuries of cultural knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we serve as more than just a marketplaceâ€”we're cultural curators, artisan advocates, and guardians of living heritage. Every purchase on our platform is an investment in cultural continuity and sustainable livelihoods.
